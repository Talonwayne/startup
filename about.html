        <h1>How to Play</h1>
        <p>Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a game where two players dynamically play 9 games of Tic Tac Toe at the same time. These smaller games come together to form one big game of Tic Tac Toe. If one player wins a smaller game of Tic Tac Toe, their symbol takes over that grid in the larger game. Whoever wins the large game of Tic Tac Toe wins the match.</p>
        <p>The smaller games of Tic Tac Toe are evaluated like normal games. If one player moves in the top corner of a smaller game, the other player must play in the corresponding top corner of the next game, if possible. The game includes a server that sends data to players logged in on the website. The history of games played is stored and used to calculate player scores, similar to the Elo rating system.</p>

    <h1>How to Play</h1>
    <p>Ultimate Tic Tac Toe.
        This is where 2 players will dynamically play 9 games of Tic Tac Toe at the same time, that come together to make one big game of tic tac toe. If one player wins a smaller game of tic tac toe, then their symbol takes over that grid in the larger game of tic tac toe. Whoever win the large game of tic tac toe wins the game. 
        The smaller games of tic tac toe are evaluated as a normal game of tic tac toe. If one team moves in the top corner on the small game then the other team must play in the top corner game if possible. The program will have a server that sends data to each of the players who login on the website. They will play games and have a simple history of the games stored. This history will then be used to calculate a player score like elo.</p>

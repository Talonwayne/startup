# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

## Explination
This Project will make a simple game called Ultimate Tic Tac Toe.
This is where 2 players will dynamically play 9 games of Tic Tac Toe at the same time, that come together to make one big game of tic tac toe. If one player wins a smaller game of tic tac toe, then their symbol takes over that grid in the larger game of tic tac toe. Whoever win the large game of tic tac toe wins the game. 


## Key Features
The smaller games of tic tac toe are evaluated as a normal game of tic tac toe. If one team moves in the top corner on the small game then the other team must play in the top corner game if possible. The program will have a server that sends data to each of the players who login on the website. They will play games and have a simple history of the games stored. This history will then be used to calculate a player score like elo.

## How Each Technology Will Be Used
### HTML
Basic structure of the website
### CSS
Small animations within the game and improved styling of the webpage. 
### JavaScript
How the users will interact with the game and call the code to run the game. 
### Webservice
The simple code to run the logic of the game and share the information between the people who are playing the game. 
### Authentication
How the players will login and the tags to keep the results of the matches. 
### Database data
Where the match history will be stored.
### WebSocket data
All of the data given from the server to the user.
